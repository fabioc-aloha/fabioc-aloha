## Our Standards

- Respect time: propose focused, actionable issues or PRs
- Encourage learning and mentorship through constructive feedback

Unacceptable behaviors:
- Harassment, discriminatory or exclusionary language
- Personal attacks or sarcasm targeting individuals

## Scope
Applies to all interactions:
- Issues, discussions, pull requests
- Commit messages and comments
- External communications referencing the project

## Reporting
If you observe unacceptable behavior:
1. Prefer private contact over public escalation
2. Email: `fabioc@microsoft.com` (primary), CC `fabio@correax.com`
3. Include: context, links, timestamps, and any prior attempts to resolve
4. For security-related concerns, see `SECURITY.md`

## Enforcement
- Initial review within **72 hours**
- Actions may include warning, PR/issue closure, or contributor block
- Severe violations may be escalated to GitHub Support
- Decisions aim for fairness, consistency, and transparency

## Attribution
Based on and inspired by community standards (Contributor Covenant v2.1) but intentionally concise for this template.

## Continuous Improvement
Suggestions to refine this Code of Conduct are welcome via issue or direct email. Adjustments will be documented in `.github/MEMORY.md` when material.

Thank you for contributing professionally and ethically.
