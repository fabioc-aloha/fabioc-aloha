# Repository Update Workflow

## 🧠 **Simple Automated Process**

When you want to update your repository documentation, just run the automated refresh command for instant updates.

### **The Workflow:**

1. **You run**: `.\refresh-repos.ps1`

2. **The automation**:
   - Runs repository analysis to collect current GitHub data
   - Automatically categorizes all repositories using dynamic logic
   - Generates complete updated `REPOS.md` with current statistics
   - Shows you a summary of what was updated

3. **You review and commit** the changes when ready
