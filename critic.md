Here is a **deep dive of your repos catalog as it presents today**, plus the fastest ways to make it tighter and more “portfolio legible” to a new visitor.

## What your catalog signals right now

1. You are running a **self updating portfolio system** centered on the `fabioc-aloha/fabioc-aloha` repo, positioned explicitly as “hands free” and automated via PowerShell plus GitHub Actions. ([GitHub][1])
2. Your public repo list currently shows **32 repositories** visible on the GitHub profile “Repositories” tab, with a mix of original work, templates, and forks. ([GitHub][2])
3. Separately, your portfolio catalog file describes a **larger collection (54 projects)**, which likely includes forks and curated items beyond the default repo list view. ([GitHub][3])

That combination is strong, but it also creates a first impression risk: a new visitor can feel “there is a lot here, but where do I start.”

## Your strongest clusters (what stands out)

### 1. Doctoral research and measurement science

Your `AIRS_Data_Analysis` repo reads like a serious research artifact: validated instrument framing, reproducible analysis structure, and thesis oriented documentation folders (chapters, tables, figures, references, executive and practitioner briefs). ([GitHub][4])

What it signals: you are not just experimenting with AI adoption, you are building an instrument and an evidence trail.

### 2. Financial analytics product thinking

`Altman-Z-Score` is unusually complete for an independent repo: CLI, portfolio parallelization, caching, dashboard generation, and multiple export formats. ([GitHub][5])

What it signals: you can take an analytics concept and ship it as a usable tool, not just a notebook.

### 3. AI assisted qualitative analysis for business workflows

`AI-Qualitative-Analysis` is framed as a practical workflow for transcript and open text analysis, with explicit controls for hallucination risk via review and validation guidance. ([GitHub][6])

What it signals: you understand how to operationalize LLMs in a way business stakeholders can trust.

### 4. Cognitive architecture and “Alex” ecosystem

`Catalyst-BABY` presents a coherent architecture (instructions, prompts, domain knowledge, scripts) and a clear activation path through Copilot instructions and PowerShell automation. ([GitHub][7])

What it signals: you are building a reusable framework, not a one off demo.

## Where the catalog is leaking value

1. **Entry point problem**
   A new visitor sees many templates and forks intermixed with flagship work. Even if your REPOS catalog is organized, the GitHub repos page still looks busy. ([GitHub][2])

2. **Brand architecture drift**
   You have multiple “Alex” or “Catalyst” variants (BABY, NEWBORN, ADHD, DBA, etc.) that are individually interesting but can blur the product story unless there is a clear hierarchy and purpose map. ([GitHub][2])

3. **Two different “truths” about the portfolio size**
   Visitors can notice 32 repos on the profile tab versus a larger catalog number in REPOS.md. That is not bad, but it needs one sentence explaining the difference (for example: “public originals plus selected forks used for learning and contribution”). ([GitHub][2])

## The highest impact improvements you can make next

1. Create a “Start Here” map
   Add a short section at the top of your main profile README that routes visitors into exactly 3 tracks:

1) Research (AIRS)
2) Applied Analytics (Altman Z Score)
3) Cognitive Architectures (Alex, Catalyst)

This reduces bounce and increases conversion to your best work. ([GitHub][8])

2. Define a portfolio taxonomy and enforce it with topics
   Use consistent GitHub topics for each repo, such as:

1) `airs` `psychometrics` `sem`
2) `financial-analytics` `risk` `dashboard`
3) `qualitative-research` `llm-evaluation`
4) `cognitive-architecture` `copilot` `automation`

You already use topics in places; make them systematic so the profile becomes navigable. ([GitHub][2])

3. Consolidate the cognitive architecture family into a single hub
   Keep the variants, but create one authoritative hub repo that answers:

1) What is Alex
2) Which template should I use and when
3) What is stable versus experimental
4) What the roadmap is

Right now `Catalyst-BABY` is close to that quality level, so it could become the hub if you want. ([GitHub][7])

4. Add “Evidence and Evaluation” sections to every flagship repo
   Your qualitative analysis repo already emphasizes validation and hallucination controls. Extend that pattern:

1) What “good” looks like (metrics)
2) How you test it
3) What limitations remain

This is the difference between “cool projects” and “credible applied research tooling.” ([GitHub][6])

## If you want me to make this brutally concrete

Tell me which direction you care about most right now:

1. Maximize academic credibility for AIRS and UTAUT3 positioning
2. Maximize executive facing product portfolio (analytics tools)
3. Maximize the Alex and Catalyst ecosystem as a framework brand

Then I will give you a prioritized backlog of repo edits (titles, descriptions, topics, pinned order, and README changes) mapped to that goal.
