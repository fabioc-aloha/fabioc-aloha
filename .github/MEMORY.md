## 5) Previous iteration changes (2025‑08‑10)
- Enabled template mode via GitHub API
- README: Added “Use this template” section with badges and quick start
- New files added:
  - `TEMPLATE-SETUP.md`: Step-by-step setup instructions for template users
  - `LICENSE`: MIT license
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Contribution guidelines
 - VS Code: Configured Copilot Chat to read `.github/copilot-instructions.md` via `github.copilot.chat.repositoryInstructions` and added fallback `chat.repositoryInstructions`.
 - Copilot repo guidance: Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to make `.github/MEMORY.md` and `.github/TODO.md` the primary context anchors (consult first; update as progress occurs).
 - P1 verifications: Confirmed fork arrow output in console, ensured JSON export is emoji-free, and synchronized counts (44/35/9/15/29) across README/REPOS/REPO-MANAGEMENT.
 - Workflow pruning: Removed optional weekly analysis workflow; prefer manual `check-forks.ps1` runs.
 - KISS/DRY: Consolidated Copilot instructions by merging "Fast playbooks" and "Meditation" into a single section; added an explicit KISS/DRY behavior and unified context anchors & references to reduce repetition and cognitive load.
 - Script enhancements: `check-forks.ps1` v2.2 now auto-detects the owner, supports `-Limit 200` by default, and sanitizes all JSON-bound fields to be emoji-free; output remains `repo-analysis.json` at the repo root.
 - Repo hygiene: Added `.gitattributes` (normalize line endings; `.ps1` CRLF) and `.gitignore` (common noise; does not ignore `repo-analysis.json`).
 - README updates: Added License/Contributing/Project Memory badges and a Requirements section (GitHub CLI ≥ 2.55, PowerShell 5.1+).
 - Template simplification: Removed `template-config-example.ps1` and scrubbed references; `TEMPLATE-SETUP.md` is the single setup guide.
 - P2 completion: Template DX and maintainability polish completed and backlog moved to post‑P2 in `.github/TODO.md`.

## 5) Current repo contents (essentials)
- **`README.md`**: Primary profile content (banner, badges, stats, areas of focus, portfolio link, contact info, and template CTA)
- **`TEMPLATE-SETUP.md`**: Guide for customizing and using this as a template
- **`LICENSE`**: MIT
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: How to contribute (docs-first guidance)
- **`ALEX-CODING.png`**: Banner image
- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**: Repository-level working memory and guidance for Copilot
- **`.vscode/settings.json`**: Points Copilot Chat to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **`check-forks.ps1`**: Repository analysis script (data collection via GitHub API)
- **`auto-update-repos.ps1`**: Automated REPOS.md generator with categorization
- **`refresh-repos.ps1`**: One-command wrapper for complete portfolio refresh

## 6) Constraints and notes
- This is a markdown-first repo; no build required
- External read-only services used: GitHub stats images, Shields.io badges
- Windows line-endings (CRLF) warnings noted by Git when staging; acceptable for this context
 - Copilot Chat is configured via `.vscode/settings.json` to load repository instructions from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; use “Developer: Show Chat Debug View” to verify system prompt includes repo guidance
 - Added `.gitattributes` to normalize line endings and `.gitignore` for common noise

## 7) Collaborative workflow pattern (established 2025-08-11)
- **Request pattern**: User says "update my repos" or similar repository update request
- **Automated execution**: Assistant runs `check-forks.ps1` script to analyze GitHub portfolio
- **Documentation sync**: Assistant uses script output to update REPOS.md and README.md as needed
- **Minimal intervention**: Process requires minimal user input, maximizes automation
- **Proven effectiveness**: Successfully tested with 44-repository analysis, accurate documentation updates
- **Memory anchor**: This workflow is the preferred method for ongoing repository maintenance

## 8) Gaps and follow-ups
- **Script hardening**: `check-forks.ps1` is upgraded (owner auto-detect, Limit, emoji-free JSON). Remaining hardening is tracked in `.github/TODO.md` (retry/backoff, guard empty lists, gh presence check, broaden sanitizer).
- **Tracking policy**: keep `repo-analysis.json` at the repository root and track snapshots in git; do not ignore.
- **Working-memory cadence**: after notable changes, sync `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/MEMORY.md`, and `.github/TODO.md` and tick the checklist.
- **Meditation trigger**: When asked to "meditate", run consolidation + synapse wiring per `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (purely cognitive; no scripts are executed; align counts/text → update MEMORY/TODO → quick quality check).
- **Future automation**: A scheduled refresh workflow could automate analysis PRs in the future, but current preference is manual runs.

## 9) How others use this template
- **One-click template**: https://github.com/fabioc-aloha/fabioc-aloha/generate
- **Setup guide**: Then follow `TEMPLATE-SETUP.md` to personalize

## 10) Philosophy
- Documentation honesty: only claim what’s implemented; avoid overstating capabilities
- Professional presentation: clean layout, badges, and clear calls-to-action
- Keep it lightweight: focus on readability and ease-of-use for the broader community
