## üîú Next Improvements (Future)

### Script hardening
- [ ] Add retry/backoff for GitHub API calls; friendly message on rate limits
- [ ] Guard against empty repo lists (avoid divide-by-zero in language percentages)
- [ ] Expand emoji sanitizer to remove ZWJ/zero-width/variation selectors
- [ ] Validate `gh` presence upfront; print guidance if missing
- [ ] Exponential backoff for auto-merge polling (6s ‚Üí 12s ‚Üí 24s)
- [ ] Persist workflow telemetry (attempt count, final merge state) as artifact or summary
- [ ] Optional local rebase/merge fallback if state remains DIRTY but no content conflicts

### Verification and tests
- [x] Enhance `auto-update-repos.ps1` with built-in validation and categorization logic
- [ ] Add Pester tests:
   - [ ] JSON schema/shape and required keys
   - [ ] Emoji sanitization invariants
   - [ ] Owner auto-detection order/fallbacks

### Linting and editor experience
- [ ] Add PSScriptAnalyzer and a `lint.ps1` convenience runner
- [ ] Add `.editorconfig` for Markdown/PowerShell formatting hints
- [ ] Add VS Code `tasks.json` entries for ‚ÄúAnalyze portfolio‚Äù and ‚ÄúVerify analysis‚Äù

### Docs polish
- [x] TEMPLATE-USER-GUIDE.md: Comprehensive troubleshooting (gh auth, execution policy, rate limits, PAT tokens)
- [ ] REPO-MANAGEMENT.md: ‚ÄúAnalyze ‚Üí Verify‚Äù sequence with expected pass/fail examples

### Maintenance ergonomics
- [ ] Add `make.ps1` (analyze + verify pipeline)
- [ ] Periodically review and trim category regex patterns

### Optional hygiene
- [ ] Add PR/issue templates (lightweight, scope cues)
- [ ] If desired, create `/analysis/` for manual snapshots of `repo-analysis.json`
